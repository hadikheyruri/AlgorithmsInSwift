# Algorithms In Swift
This repo contains implementations for some of the common Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift programming language.

## The Data Structure implemented include:
 - Basic Binary Tree
 - Stack
 - Trie
 - Heap
 - Graphs
 - Deque
 - LinkedLists
 - QuickSort
 - MergeSort 
 - etc.
 
Additionally some of the common algorithmic problems are solved in three categories:
- Problems that do not require a specific structure implemented in the DSA_Easy.swift. 
- Problems that use Arrays as part of the solution implemented in DSA_Array
- and the third category of problems that use some form of Dictionary in the solution under the DSA_Dictionary.

## Tests
For running the algorithms please see the Unit Tests.

## Purpose
These implementations are implemented and shared for entertainment only and are not meant for production environments.
